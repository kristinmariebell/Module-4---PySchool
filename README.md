School Analysis Report


Information regarding math and reading scores from all students in 9th through 12rth grade were examined across each of the 15 schools in the district.  We also had information about eh schoolâ€™s budget which helped us draw some conclusions about the effect of spending per student has on the outcome of the grades of the students. 

The top five schools by Overall Passing percentage(of math and reading) were: Cabrera High School at 91.33%, Thomas High School at 90.95%, Griffin High School at 90.60%, Wilson High School at 90.58% and Pena High School at 90.54%, which are all Charter Schools. In contract, the bottom five schools by Overall Passing percentage (of math and reading) were Rodriguez High School at 52.99%, Figueroa High School at 53.20%, Huang High School at 53.51%, Hernandez High School at 53.53% and Johnson High School at 53.54%, which are all District Schools. This shows clearly that Charter Schools are outperforming District Schools when using Overall Passing percentage as the factor.

One might assume that that schools that have a higher amount spend per student would translate to higher test scores, but the data does not support that theory. For example, the school with the highest amount of their budget spent per student was Huang High School, spending $655/student, which is a district school. And Wilson High School has the lowest amount spent per student at $578/student.

I think a significant factor is the population of the top performing schools versus the population of the poorest performing schools. The population at the top school (Cabrera High School) is 1,858 students and the population at the poorest performing school (Rodriguez High School) is approximately double at 3,999. I believe this suggests that the class sizes and perhaps teacher to student ratio is resulting in better grades, as opposed to more money spend on the more populated schools.
